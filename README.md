 Heart Attack Prediction Algorithm ðŸ©ºðŸ’“

This project addresses the critical task of predicting and displaying the risk of a heart attack based on basic information such as age, sex, chest pain type (cp), and other relevant factors. By employing the powerful LogisticRegression model, we have developed an algorithm that provides accurate predictions for this life-threatening condition.

Data Set: To train and validate our algorithm, we utilized the Heart.csv dataset sourced from Kaggle.com. This dataset contains a comprehensive collection of attributes associated with heart health, making it an ideal resource for our predictive model.

Algorithm: LogisticRegression was chosen as our primary model due to its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. By training the algorithm on the Heart.csv data, we successfully generated a model capable of accurately predicting heart attack risks.

Results: Through rigorous evaluation and testing, our algorithm achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 84.7% (or 85%). These results demonstrate the reliability and effectiveness of our heart attack prediction system.

Discussion: Our project not only focuses on providing accurate predictions but also aims to raise awareness about heart health. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can identify potential risks and prompt individuals to seek necessary medical attention.
